**Data management for Analytics Project Milestone-1** 

**Real world business problem definition** 

A database model for an online shopping system must be able to hold data on the users who register on the website and place orders. The products that are for sale must also be listed, together with their prices and stock information. Before placing their order, customers must be allowed to add things they choose from the catalog to a shopping cart. Each consumer should then be able to keep track of their wish list, which is a collection of goods they are considering buying but haven't yet put in their shopping cart. The data model must be able to record the order information and payment when the customer confirms an order. 

**Conceptual Data Model for E-Commerce Website and itâ€™s Entities** 

The first step in creating a conceptual database model for an e-commerce website is to list all the system entities and their attributes. The following entities can be found in the majority of online purchasing data models: 

- **Customer**: This entity stands for users of the online shopping platform who register and create accounts in order to place orders. 
- **Product:** Describes the assortment of goods that may be purchased via the platform. 
- **Category:** The groups of products that make up this category. 
- **Order:** Purchase orders made by clients. 
- **Items :** included in an order are referred to as order items. 
- **Payment :** The sum the consumer pays after the order has been fulfilled. 
- **Shipment** : Shipping details for an order, such as the delivery address and the tracking number, are referred to as the "shipment" details. 
- **Cart**: The customer's electronic shopping bag or basket, which holds products until they are bought and added to an order. 
- **Wishlist :** The customer's wish list contains the things they have selected for potential future purchases. 

**Extended Entity-Relationship** 

1. **Customer and Order:** Customer and Order have a one-to-many relationship, which means a single customer can place several orders, but only one customer is linked to each order. 
1. **Order and Order Item:** The connection between an order and an order item is one to many. This implies that while a single order may include many items (products), each order item is associated with a particular order. You can keep track of the products inside each order thanks to this relationship. 
1. **Order Item and Product:** Order Item and Product are related in a many-to-one manner. Although a product may be tied to more than one order item, each order item is associated with a single product. This connection makes it easier to connect the particular product in each order item. 
1. **Payment and Order:** Order and Payment have a one-to-many relationship. One payment may be made for each order, however several orders may be connected to one payment. This connection makes it possible to keep track of payments made for each order. 
1. **Shipment and Order**: There is also a one-to-many relationship between Shipment and Order. Each order can have one shipment, but a shipment can be associated with multiple orders. This relationship helps manage the shipping process for each order. 
1. **Product and Category:** One product belongs to one category, but a category might have several products because there is a one-to-many relationship between the two. This association categorizes products for simpler management and browsing. 
1. **Customer, Cart, and Wishlist:** Both Cart and Wishlist are dependent entities of Customer, which implies that they maintain a dependency relationship with the Customer entity. Each customer can have one shopping cart and one wish list. 
1. **Cart and Wishlist with Product:** There are many-to-one links between the entities Cart and Wishlist and Product. This indicates that a single product may be linked to each instance of the 

   Cart and Wishlist. Customers can add multiple products to their cart and Wishlist, but each product is associated with a specific cart or Wishlist. 

9. **Product and order Item :** A many-to-one relationship can be used to define the relationship between a product and an order item. Several order items can be related to the same product, which can be the case for multiple goods in various orders.
9. **Cart and Customer :** Each customer only have one shopping cart that they use to store products they intend to buy, hence the relationship between the cart and the customer can be regarded as a one-to-one relationship.

ER Model of E commerce Website 

**Reference and Transactional data** 

**Reference Data:** 

Information that is static or semi-static and doesn't change often is represented by reference data. Reference information on an e-commerce website could consist of the following: 

1. Customer Information: 
   1. CustomerID (Primary Key) 
   1. Name 
   1. Email 
   1. Phone Number 
1. Product Information: 
   1. ProductID (Primary Key) 
   1. Name 
   1. Price 
   1. Stock 
   1. CategoryID (Foreign Key to Category) 
1. Category Information: 
   1. CategoryID (Primary Key) 
   1. Category Name 
1. Payment Methods: 
- PaymentMethodID (Primary Key) 
- Payment Method Name 

**Transactional Data:** 

Transactional data is information that is updated often and keeps track of particular transactions or events. This contains information about orders, carts, wishlists, payments, shipments, and order items in an e-commerce context: 

1. Order Information: 
   1. OrderID (Primary Key) 
   1. Order Date 
   1. Order Price 
   1. CustomerID (Foreign Key to Customer) 
1. Order Items: 
   1. OrderItemID (Primary Key) 
   1. Quantity 
   1. Price 
   1. ProductID (Foreign Key to Product) 
   1. OrderID (Foreign Key to Order) 
1. Payment Transactions: 
   1. PaymentID (Primary Key) 
   1. Payment Date 
   1. Amount 
   1. PaymentMethodID (Foreign Key to Payment Methods) 
   1. CustomerID (Foreign Key to Customer) 
   1. OrderID (Foreign Key to Order) 
1. Shipment Information: 
- ShipmentID (Primary Key) 
- Shipment Date 
- AddressID (Foreign Key to Address) 
5. Cart Information: 
   1. CartID (Primary Key) 
   1. Quantity 
   1. ProductID (Foreign Key to Product) 
   1. CustomerID (Foreign Key to Customer) 
5. Wishlist Information: 
   1. WishlistID (Primary Key) 
   1. ProductID (Foreign Key to Product) 
   1. CustomerID (Foreign Key to Customer) 
5. Address Information: 
- AddressID (Primary Key) 
- Pin 
- City 
- State 
- Country 
- Zip code 
- CustomerID (Foreign Key to Customer) 

As clients engage with the e-commerce website, particular transactional data can be recorded and kept in each of these tables. This structure enables you to efficiently support the operations and functionality of the online shopping system by storing and managing both reference data and transactional data.

- The transfer of order items to their own "OrderItem" database simplifies orders. 
- Payment data is associated with specific clients. 
- Wishlists and shopping carts are connected to clients. 
- Product data is kept apart from the "Product" table, which has a foreign key called CategoryID to link products to categories. 
- Distinct categories are kept up to date.

## Introduction - ![ref7]
Welcome to our E-commerce Database Model  Presentation. Our system is tailored to manage  user details, orders, product listings with prices  and stocks, carts, Wishlist, and payment  information for seamless online shopping. The  model showcases entities like Customers,  Products, Orders, Payments, Shipments, and  their relationships. It ensures efficient  ![ref8]operations by allowing users to register, place  orders, add products to carts or wishlists, and  finalize payments. Join us as we explore how  our model optimizes the online shopping  experience.

## Summary ![](./src/Aspose.Words.97ab8d6c-5a46-493a-a322-7b8e9759d5b8.135.png)![ref7]
The conceptual database model for an e-commerce platform comprises entities like  

Customer, Product, Order, Payment, Shipment, Cart, Wishlist, and Category, each  

with specific attributes and relationships. Customers place orders connected through a one-to-many relationship, while order items link orders and products, facilitating 

tracking of items in each order. Payments and shipments maintain one-to-many ties with orders, managing payment details and shipping specifics. Categories categorize products, 

aiding in organization. Reference data includes static customer and product info, 

while transactional data captures dynamic details like orders, payments, and shipments, 

crucial for the system's real-time operation and effective e-commerce functionality.
